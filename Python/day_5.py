 Hey, today is my 5th day of learning python with code with harry
 Here we will learn- comments, escape sequence, and print statements'''

#escape sequence

# we use backslash for escape sequence
print("Hello guys,\nWelcome to learn python with\ncode with Harry") # \n for new line


print("Hello, I am a \"Good boy\"")      # \ for " in good boy 

# sep="" to separate using someting 
# end="" to end the print statement with something
#Example
print("Hey", 6, 7, sep="~", end="552\n") #this hey ,6 and 7 will be printed separating with ~ symbol and end with something
print("This is a new line")
